    <h1>Salify Credit Access Project</h1>
    <p>
      Salify Credit Access is a financial services initiative designed to improve access to credit for individuals and SMEs in Zambia. 
      The project focuses on developing robust loan assessment procedures, streamlining operations, and promoting responsible lending practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      My role involved creating tailored terms and conditions, implementing risk management frameworks, and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. 
      We also focused on building client trust through transparent processes, effective communication, and consistent monitoring of repayment performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key outcomes included enhanced operational efficiency, increased loan portfolio growth, and improved financial literacy among clients. 
      The project demonstrated the importance of combining technology-driven solutions with customer-centered strategies to expand financial inclusion and strengthen economic participation in Zambia.

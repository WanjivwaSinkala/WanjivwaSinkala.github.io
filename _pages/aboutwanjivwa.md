**About Me**

I am a results-oriented development economist and operations professional with a strong interdisciplinary foundation in economic policy, monitoring and evaluation, and organizational risk management. I hold a Master of Arts in Economic Policy Management from the University of Zambia, a Postgraduate Diploma in Monitoring and Evaluation Methods, and a Bachelor of Arts in Development Studies with Economics from the same institution.

Over the past decade, I have developed a dynamic career across the development, financial, and retail sectorsâ€”supporting program implementation, internal controls, procurement, and risk oversight. My work has spanned both the private sector and non-profit initiatives, reflecting my commitment to inclusive development and systems that drive accountability and performance.

My professional experience includes leading administrative operations for multi-stakeholder development projects, most notably with Plant A Million Zambia (PAMZ), where I coordinated logistics and procurement for collaborative tree-planting campaigns with Care International and Standard Chartered Bank. I successfully ensured the timely distribution of over 1,600 seedlings and maintained stakeholder reporting and communication frameworks that enhanced project transparency and delivery.

In the retail sector, I have served in key administrative and compliance roles with EDCON (T/A Jet Supermarket Zambia) and Masscash Holdings (Pty) Ltd (T/A Jumbo Wholesale Zambia Ltd), where I developed and managed internal control systems, reduced operational losses, improved inventory accuracy, and contributed to talent development by mentoring junior staff. I have consistently applied compliance frameworks and process improvement strategies that enhanced operational efficiency and mitigated institutional risk.

My early roles in banking with Standard Chartered Bank Zambia and Access Bank Zambia strengthened my understanding of credit risk, compliance documentation, and customer data governance, laying a solid foundation for my analytical and reporting skills.

Core competencies I bring to every role include:

- Reviewing transactions and documentation to flag anomalies and reduce operational risk.
- Strengthening internal controls and ensuring adherence to regulatory frameworks.
- Managing accurate stock documentation, reconciliations, and logistics coordination.
- Engaging stakeholders and clients effectively while maintaining service quality and delivery targets.
- Utilizing Microsoft Office tools (Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Access) for data management, with exposure to M&E reporting tools and frameworks.

As a development professional trained in economic policy and M&E, I am passionate about evidence-based decision-making, transparent operations, and contributing to sustainable economic growth. I am particularly interested in projects that bridge policy and implementation, enabling institutions to achieve measurable development outcomes through data-driven strategies and operational excellence.

**Welcome to my website**

I am a development economist with interests in economic policy, program evaluation, and financial inclusion. I hold a Master of Arts in Economic Policy Management and a Postgraduate Diploma in Monitoring and Evaluation methods (M&E) from the University of Zambia.

Previously, I supported reforestation and institutional strengthening initiatives through collaborations with Care International, Standard Chartered Bank, and the Plant A Million Zambia campaign. My background includes roles across the development, retail, and banking sectors, with a focus on administration, operations, compliance, and systems improvement.

**Welcome**

I am Wanjivwa Sinkala, a development economist and operations professional driven by a deep commitment to inclusive growth, evidence-based decision-making, and institutional integrity. My academic background in **Economic Policy Management**, **Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)**, and **Development Studies with Economic** supports a cross-cutting career in development research, financial operations, and program delivery.

I work at the intersection of policy, systems, and practice ensuring that programs are not only well-designed but also effectively implemented, monitored, and refined. With hands-on experience across the development, retail, and banking sectors, I bring a results-oriented approach that emphasizes accountability, learning, and sustainable impact.

My research Interests includes but not limited to;

- Economic policy and sustainable development
- Monitoring and evaluation systems
- Livelihood and market systems development
- Financial inclusion and development finance

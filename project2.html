    <h1>Project 2: Sustainability & Climate Resilience Initiative</h1>
    <p>
      This project was carried out in collaboration with <strong>Standard Chartered Bank Zambia</strong>, 
      Care International, FNB Zambia, and the Patients Aid Management Initiative (PAMZ). 
      The focus was on <strong>reforestation and environmental stewardship</strong> to address 
      the growing threats of deforestation and climate change.
    </p>

    <p>
      Activities included <strong>community tree planting campaigns</strong>, 
      sensitization workshops on sustainable land use, and support for local climate-smart practices. 
      The initiative aimed to both restore degraded areas and build community awareness of the 
      importance of environmental conservation for long-term resilience.
    </p>

    <p>
      My contribution involved mobilizing community members, coordinating logistics, and monitoring 
      progress of the tree planting efforts to ensure survival rates of saplings remained sustainable 
      beyond the planting stage.

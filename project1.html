    <h1>USAID Alternatives to Charcoal (A2C) Project Evaluation</h1>
    <p>
      The USAID-funded Alternatives to Charcoal (A2C) project (2021–2026) seeks to 
      reduce deforestation and promote sustainable energy practices in Lusaka, Zambia, 
      by encouraging households to adopt Alternative Technologies and Fuels (ATFs), 
      including improved cookstoves and renewable energy solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This evaluation assessed the project’s implementation processes, focusing on identifying 
      and addressing market barriers and evaluating the design and delivery of social behaviour 
      change and communication interventions. Participatory methods such as workshops, community 
      meetings, and surveys were central to identifying challenges, including limited resources 
      and logistical constraints, which affected timelines and implementation strategies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Social behaviour change interventions were delivered primarily through community meetings, 
      with complementary engagement via social media and workshops. While effective overall, 
      the evaluation highlighted resource constraints and some resistance from target audiences, 
      emphasizing the need for tailored communication strategies to encourage wider adoption of ATFs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The findings underscore the importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration, robust community 
      engagement, and integrating market interventions with alternative livelihood strategies. 
      Lessons learned from this evaluation provide a foundation for scaling and refining interventions, 
      contributing to Zambia’s environmental conservation and sustainable energy transition goals.

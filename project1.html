    <h1>USAID Alternatives to Charcoal (A2C) Project Evaluation</h1>
    
    <p>
      As part of my Postgraduate Diploma in Monitoring & Evaluation Methods (2024/25), 
      I conducted a <strong>process evaluation</strong> of the USAID-funded 
      <em>Alternatives to Charcoal (A2C)</em> project (2021–2026). 
      The project aims to reduce deforestation in Lusaka by promoting the adoption 
      of Alternative Technologies and Fuels (ATFs), such as improved cookstoves and renewable energy solutions.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Assessed project implementation processes, focusing on market barriers and adoption of ATFs.</li>
      <li>Reviewed the design and delivery of Social Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) interventions.</li>
      <li>Applied participatory evaluation methods including workshops, meetings, and surveys.</li>
      <li>Identified challenges such as limited resources and audience resistance, highlighting the need for stronger stakeholder engagement and capacity building.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The evaluation emphasized the importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration, 
      tailored communication strategies, and integrated livelihood approaches 
      to scale ATF adoption. These insights inform future programming and contribute 
      to Zambia’s environmental conservation and clean energy transition goals.

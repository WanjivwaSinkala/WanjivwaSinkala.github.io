    <h1>USAID Alternatives to Charcoal (A2C) Project Evaluation</h1>
    <p>
      The USAID Alternatives to Charcoal (A2C) project seeks to reduce deforestation and promote 
      sustainable energy practices in Lusaka, Zambia, by encouraging households to adopt 
      Alternative Technologies and Fuels (ATFs), such as improved cookstoves and renewable 
      energy solutions. This evaluation aimed to assess the project’s implementation processes, 
      focusing on identifying and addressing market barriers and evaluating the design and 
      delivery of social behaviour change and communication (SBCC) interventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key findings revealed that participatory methods, including workshops (42.9%), meetings 
      (35.7%), and surveys (21.4%), were central to identifying market barriers. However, 
      challenges such as limited resources and logistical constraints were significant, affecting 
      timelines and implementation strategies. To mitigate these, stakeholder engagement and 
      capacity-building initiatives were highlighted as critical solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      SBCC interventions were designed using participatory approaches and delivered primarily 
      through community meetings (70%), with social media (50%) and workshops (40%) playing 
      complementary roles. Despite their overall effectiveness, challenges such as resource 
      constraints and resistance from target audiences were noted, emphasizing the need to address 
      barriers to facilitate broader adoption of ATFs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The findings show the importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration, robust community 
      engagement, and tailored communication strategies in overcoming barriers to ATF adoption. 
      These insights have implications for future programming, emphasizing the need for integrated 
      approaches that combine market interventions with alternative livelihood strategies to 
      reduce charcoal production sustainably. The lessons learned provide a foundation for scaling 
      and refining interventions, contributing to Zambia’s environmental conservation and energy 
      transition goals.

    <h1>Tree Planting & Reforestation Initiative</h1>
    
    <p>
      As part of community and environmental conservation initiatives, I contributed to a tree planting and reforestation 
      project in collaboration with Standard Chartered Bank Zambia, PAMZ, Care International Zambia, and other partners. 
      The project aimed to combat deforestation, improve urban green spaces, and raise awareness on climate resilience 
      in local communities.
    </p>

    <p>
      My involvement included organizing community engagement activities, coordinating with stakeholders, and supporting 
      monitoring efforts to track the growth and survival of planted trees. The initiative emphasized sustainable 
      environmental practices and encouraged community ownership of reforestation efforts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Key outcomes included increased tree cover in targeted areas, strengthened partnerships between financial institutions 
      and community organizations, and enhanced public awareness of environmental stewardship and climate-smart practices.

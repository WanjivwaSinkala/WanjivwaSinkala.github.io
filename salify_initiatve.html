    <h1>Salify Credit Access (Upcoming Initiative - 2026)</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Salify Credit Access (SCA)</strong> is an upcoming financial inclusion initiative that I plan to 
      launch in <strong>2026</strong>. Its mission is to provide individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), 
      and underserved communities in Zambia with access to affordable, transparent, and flexible financial solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initiative will focus on developing <em>customer-centered loan assessment procedures</em>, implementing 
      effective risk management frameworks, and ensuring compliance with national financial regulations. 
      By leveraging digital platforms and innovative service delivery, SCA aims to streamline lending operations 
      and strengthen financial literacy among clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking ahead, key expected outcomes include expanded financial inclusion, enhanced operational efficiency, 
      and increased opportunities for entrepreneurship and income generation. 
      Salify Credit Access is designed to combine <strong>technology-driven innovation</strong> with 
      <strong>responsible lending practices</strong> to contribute to Zambia’s economic growth.
